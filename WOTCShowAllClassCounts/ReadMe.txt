[WOTC] Show All Class Counts


Displays how many soldiers of each class do you have at the top of the Armory interface, including rookies, faction hero classes and SPARKs.

Number of soldiers of classes that can be trained in Guerilla Tactics School (GTS) is always displayed, even if that number is zero.
For other "soldier classes", such as SPARKs, faction heroes and mod-added characters, the count is displayed only if you have at least one "soldier" of that class.

This mod is an extension of the [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1291868747]WotC: Show GTS Class Counts[/url][/b] mod by robojumper, made with his permission. The difference is that robojumper's mod displays only GTS-trainable soldier classes, while Show All Class Counts displays all classes, regardless if they can be trained in GTS or not.

[h1]REQUIREMENTS[/h1]

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1134256495][b]X2 WOTC Community Highlander[/b][/url] is required.

Safe to add or remove mid-campaign.

[h1]COMPATIBILITY[/h1]

[b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1291868747]WotC: Show GTS Class Counts[/url][/b] - these two mods should not be used together, or you will see duplicate entries for GTS-trainable classes.

Other than that, should be compatible with almost anything, including mod-added soldier classes.

Mod-added interface screens may or may not be supported out of the box.

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]
[list][*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1148535137]Disable Any Class Wotc[/url][/b] does not prevent you from training "disabled" classes in Guerilla Tactics School, so the mod will still display entries for "disabled" classes in the armory.
[*]If you run a lot of soldier class mods at the same time, there might not be enough room in the interface to display all of them. No, I cannot do anything about that, please stop asking. No, I cannot add a second bar.[/list]

[h1]CONFIGURATION[/h1]

The mod is configurable through [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667104300]Mod Config Menu[/url][/b] and:
